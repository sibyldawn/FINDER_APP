* This full-stack REACT app was created for a group project using AGILE PROJECT
MANAGEMENT.
Built the front-end with REACT, JAVASCRIPT, JSX, SASS, GOOGLE MATERIALS-UI,
CONTEXT API, AXIOS, and REACT ROUTER.

* REACT set up the foundation for this application and made it faster as it created
a virtual DOM which only changed components that were mounted or updated.

* Knowing JAVASCRIPT and all the different data types helped me manipulate
data to control my REACT application.

* Proficiency in JAVASCRIPT, REACT, HTML, and CSS made â€¢ writing JSX easy.
Learning new technology is exciting so I learned how to use Google Materials-
UI on my own and integrated it into different components of my REACT
application together with SASS.

* Using MATERIALS-UI on my REACT app taught me how to apply CSS in JS and
inline styling.

* CONTEXT API made state, props, and methods management quicker. User login
is stored in EXPRESS-SESSIONS as well.

* Functions to find matches and swiping involved a JAVASCRIPT and REACTMOTION-
STACK.

* Upon matching, ASYNCHRONOUS events happen to create a chat room for the
two users and they can begin chatting with each other.

* Chat capabilities are powered by CHATKIT API and involves understanding their
documentation to communicate with their REST API endpoints.

* Built the server with NODE JS and EXPRESS with different endpoints to Create,
Read, Update, and Delete data from my POSTGRES database with the help of
MASSIVE.

* Saving information was made easy using my own POSTGRES database which
involved a users table, a connections table, and a chat room table. I created
and tested database queries using SQL with the help of SQL Tabs.

* Authorization is handled with Auth0 which allow clients to Log In with LinkedIn.
Clients may also choose to sign up with their e-mail and password which are
encrypted and saved by Auth0. In order to do this I used NODE JS and EXPRESS.

* In this REACT app clients are given a choice to upload a new profile image
through our drag and drop form which uses CLOUDINARY to safely host their
picture.

* Upon a match event when both an applicant and a recruiter showed interest an
e-mail is sent to both users to notify them of this match from our REACT app
using NODEMAILER.

* AXIOS calls and promises in my REACT app are handled ASYNCHRONOUSLY to
create a smooth flow of USER EXPERIENCE as they log in, update their Profile,
find matches and chat with others in this REACT website.
